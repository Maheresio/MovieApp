**Flutter Movie App Project**  

- Developed a **cross-platform movie app** using **Flutter** and **Dart**, leveraging the **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** pattern for state management to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.  
- Integrated with **The Movie Database (TMDb) API** to fetch and display real-time movie data, including **now playing**, **popular**, and **top-rated movies**, as well as detailed movie information and recommendations.  
- Implemented **caching** using the `cached_network_image` package to optimize image loading and improve app performance.  
- Designed a **responsive and user-friendly UI** with features like **carousel sliders**, **animated transitions**, and **custom fonts** using the `google_fonts` package.  
- Utilized **Dio** for efficient network requests and error handling, ensuring robust data fetching and API communication.  
- Added **loading animations** and **shimmer effects** to enhance the user experience during data fetching.  
- Implemented **navigation** between screens, including a **splash screen**, **movie list screen**, and **movie detail screen**, with smooth transitions and dynamic data loading.  
- Followed **best practices** for code organization, including separation of concerns, dependency injection, and modular architecture.  
- Used **Git** for version control and collaborated with team members to ensure code quality and project consistency.  

**Technologies Used**:  
- Flutter, Dart, BLoC, Dio, Cached Network Image, Carousel Slider, Google Fonts, Shimmer, Lottie, Sizer  

**Key Achievements**:  
- Delivered a fully functional and visually appealing movie app with seamless navigation and real-time data integration.  
- Improved app performance by implementing caching and optimizing network requests.  
- Enhanced user experience with animations, transitions, and responsive design.
